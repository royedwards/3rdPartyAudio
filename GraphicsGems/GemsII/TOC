    Well, I figured that a lot of people would probably be interested in
this, so I went ahead and typed it in.  You folks had BETTER appreciate
this!  =^)

    By the way, the dates for Graphics Gems III are as follows:

    01-Oct-91:  Submit first draft of gem and C code.
    01-Nov-91:  Notification of acceptance and need for revision.
    01-Dec-91:  Submit final manuscript, figures and C code.
       Mar-92:  Review page proofs.
    24-Jul-92:  Publication
    27-Jul-92:  Celebration at SIGGRAPH '92.

    For further information (and an author's packet), you can send
e-mail to Jenifer Swetland at cdp!jswetland@labrea.stanford.edu.

    The table of contents for Graphics Gems II follows my signature.
