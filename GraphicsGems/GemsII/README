    C Code From Graphics Gems II, Academic Press, Inc.
    ==================================================


    This is a list of the files and directories containing the C code for Graphics Gems II.  
    They are listed in order of their appearance in the book.  Beside each file name is the 
    Gem number, author's name, and Gem title to help you find what you're looking for.  
    Unfortunately, not all of the code listed in the appendix of the book is here (for various 
    reasons).  The missing ones will be added as they turn up.  Changes will be listed at the
    bottom of this file.
