The source is the implementation of a gem, "Implementing Progressive Radiosity
with User-Provided Polygon Display Routines," that I wrote for Graphics Gems II.
A hard copy of the source can be found in Appendix II of Graphics Gems II.
The source included here is a newer version than the one in the book 
and should replace it. For more details on the source and radiosity methods, 
please refer to the book.

No warranties expressed, implied, or even hinted at.

The source is written in ANSI C and is C++ friendly (you can include the
.h files in C++ programs). 

Please send bug reports and/or enhancements to the author "chense@apple.com".
I would also like to hear any system that you have ported the source to.
However, please don't ask me for technical support on the source.
