This directory contains the files necessary to vectorize a 2D shape.

vectorize.C        /* main routine             */
test.C             /* interface for the prog   */
pt2D.h             /* a header                 */
pt2D.C             /* a 2D point package       */
chainCode.h        /* a header                 */
chainCode.C        /* a chain code class       */
Makefile           /* the makefile             */
bitmap_1           /* a test file              */
bitmap_2           /* another test file        */
bitmap_3           /* a third test file        */

The program is written in C++. I used gcc2.1 to compile it.
To run the demo, simply type:

>> make
>> vectorize some_file



You can view the bitmap files by typing:
>> cat some_file

since the files are encoded in text. The program will display the results
and save them in '.vec' file. You can get more explanations by simply
typing 'vectorize' without arguments. As you will notice, the file does not
use GraphicsGems.m. This is because the programs needs 2D integer operations
and GraphicsGems.m only provides 2D floating point operations through the
Point2 type.

Only the 5 files:
vectorize.C
pt2D.h
pt2D.C
chainCode.h
chainCode.C

are meant to make it for the book and the disk accompanying it.


JFD.
