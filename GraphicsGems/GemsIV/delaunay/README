C++ code from the article
"Incremental Delaunay Triangulation"
by Dani Lischinski, danix@graphics.cornell.edu
in "Graphics Gems IV", Academic Press, 1994


test.C contains an interactive test program for Delaunay triangulation.
The program should compile and run on SGI workstations.
Use left-mouse to add new points.

The rest of the code is more portable (not limited to SGIs).
