C code from the article
"Multi-Jittered Sampling"
by Kenneth Chiu, Peter Shirley, and Changyaw Wang,
  (chiuk@cs.indiana.edu, shirley@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu,
   and wangc@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu)
in "Graphics Gems IV", Academic Press, 1994

files:
    multi.c - source file
    Makefile - make file; creates executable called "multi"
    test.c  - test program that performs consistency checks on
	the generated sampling pattern

The makefile uses 'gcc' as the compiler, but any ANSI compatible compiler
should do.

To run the test program, give it three arguments.  The first two are
'm' and 'n' (as described in the gem), and the last one is a seed
to the random number generator.
