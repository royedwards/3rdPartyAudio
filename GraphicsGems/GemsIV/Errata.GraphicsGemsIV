The following are errors in the code listings (corrected in the online code at
princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/GraphicsGems/GemsIV).  Note that many of the code
listings online are different in minor and major ways from the code in the
book.

[none so far]

Syntax errors (ones that are not usually harmful, or are easily caught):

[none so far]

A new point in polygon test has been added to ptpoly_haines/ptinpoly.c, a
variation on the Crossings test which is about 15% faster for triangles.

A potential divide by zero error has been removed from
ptpoly_haines/ptinpoly.c; line 1286 had "inv_y = tmax / ydiff;", which is
now deleted.
